# Diretta_Server_Mngt
Diretta server installation and management

I have gathered here a few scripts I am using to :
- install a Diretta server on a basic Fedora installation
- compile a RT kernel based on vanilla kernel repositories
- tune the server and seggregate processes btwn house keeping/Diretta/HQPlayer Embedded
- adjust the tuning of Diretta communication protocol based on the mtu of the network and the sampling frequency of the audio played

Diretta is a high-end communication protocol aimed at high-end audio rendering. Diretta is a trade-mark registered. Please see www.diretta.link for more information
HQPlayer is a high-end upsampling software developed by Jussi Laako. HQPlayer and HQPe are registered trade-marks. Please see www.signalyst.com fro more information.
